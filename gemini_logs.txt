--- AuthGate Modification and Role-Based Testing Instructions ---
- Modified lib/auth/auth_gate.dart to implement role-based redirection using Firestore to fetch user roles.
- Provided detailed step-by-step instructions on:
    - Creating user accounts in Firebase Authentication.
    - Adding user roles to Firestore.
    - Deploying Firestore Security Rules for role-based access.
    - Testing the app for different roles.
Okay, here's a step-by-step guide to test role-based access in your app:

  Part 1: Prepare Your Firebase Project

   1. Create User Accounts in Firebase Authentication:
       * Option A (Via App): Run your Flutter app, go to the signup screen, and create accounts for each role
         (e.g., main_admin@example.com, school_admin@example.com, teacher@example.com, student@example.com,
         parent@example.com).
       * Option B (Via Firebase Console): Go to Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Users -> "Add user".
         Create accounts with email and password.
       * Important: For each user created, note down their User UID (User ID) from the Firebase Console.

   2. Add User Roles to Firestore:
       * Go to Firebase Console -> Firestore Database.
       * Create a new collection named users.
       * For each user created in Step 1:
           * Click "Add document".
           * Set the Document ID to the User UID you noted down.
           * Add a field: Field name: role, Field type: string, Field value: [the role, e.g., 'main_admin'].
           * Click "Save".
       * Repeat for all your test users (main\_admin, school\_admin, teacher, student, parent).

   3. Deploy Firestore Security Rules:
       * Open the firestore.rules file in your project's root directory.
       * Replace its content with the example rules I provided previously (or your own adapted rules for
         role-based access).
       * Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
       * Run the command: firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
       * This will upload your security rules to Firebase.

  Part 2: Test the App

   1. Run Your Flutter App:
       * Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
       * Run the command: flutter run -d chrome (or your preferred device).

   2. Perform Role-Based Testing:
       * Once the app launches, you will be at the login/signup screen.
       * Login as Main Admin: Enter the email and password for your main_admin test account.
           * Expected: You should be redirected to the MainAdminDashboardScreen.
           * Test: Verify that you can access/see elements intended for the main admin.
       * Logout: Implement a logout button in your app (if not already present) or clear app data in your
         browser/emulator.
       * Login as School Admin: Enter the email and password for your school_admin test account.
           * Expected: You should be redirected to the SchoolAdminDashboardScreen.
           * Test: Verify its functionalities.
       * Repeat for all other roles: Log in as teacher, student, and parent accounts, verifying that each is
         redirected to their respective dashboard (TeacherDashboardScreen, StudentDashboardScreen,
         ParentDashboardScreen) and that their specific functionalities work as expected.
