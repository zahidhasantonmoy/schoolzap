The cow is a domestic animal. It is a four-footed, herbivorous mammal. Cows are known for their gentle nature and for providing milk, which is a staple food for many people around the world. They spend a large part of their day grazing in fields, chewing their cud. The sound a cow makes is called a "moo".
